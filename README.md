# ps-model-mapper

**Common utilities for bidirectionally mapping data between two models**

 If you need to map and transform data from one model (format) to another, this is the module for you!
 
Provide one JSON configuration that connects the two models, and use `ps-model-mapper` to interpret and apply that
configuration onto real data you provide in one format to output the other.
